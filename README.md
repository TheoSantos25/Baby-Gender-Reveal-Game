## üåü Game Overview

Friends and family are invited to:
1.  **Get Started:** A welcoming intro screen (with an optional "rotate device" prompt for mobile users) sets the stage and explains the simple game mechanics.
2.  **Solve the Puzzle:** Click on three animated circular puzzle pieces in the correct sequence. Each piece is a vibrant color and features a unique emoji hint (üó£Ô∏è, üë£, üïØÔ∏è) with an animated question mark. The puzzle area itself has a dynamic, abstract gradient background, ensuring no premature hints are given.
3.  **Follow Along:** A colorful and animated walkthrough panel guides players, highlighting the active step with a pulsing glow and marking completed steps with a satisfying checkmark animation.
4.  **Build Suspense:** Each correct click reveals a word ("IT'S", "A"). The final click unveils a "?" to build maximum anticipation before the grand announcement.
5.  **The Grand Reveal!**
    * The screen transitions to a spectacular reveal sequence.
    * The background features the "shelf scene" image (`https://i.imgur.com/EWm3Cjd.jpeg`) blended with a blue overlay that becomes more transparent after a few seconds, making the image clearer.
    * Animated text elements ("IT'S A BOY!", "Leander Ratna H Santos", "Our little Boy!") appear sequentially with playful zoom effects and vibrant, contrasting colors with strong shadows/glows.
    * The screen is filled with dynamic celebratory effects: an abundance of colorful confetti, starbursts, and floating balloons.
    * A majestic piano melody accompanies this reveal.
    * This screen lasts for 10 seconds before automatically transitioning to the slideshow.
6.  **Our Pregnancy Journey (Slideshow):**
    * A continuous, gentle Einaudi-style piano melody plays.
    * Personalized pregnancy photos are displayed with captions. Each image container initially appears smaller, then smoothly expands after 3 seconds to nearly fill the page width, framed by an animated gradient border.
    * **The Grand Finale Slide:**
        * The "shelf scene" image (`https://i.imgur.com/EWm3Cjd.jpeg`) is displayed.
        * It first pans and zooms into the "IT'S A BOY" detail on the letter board.
        * Then, this panned/zoomed view performs a gentle "settle zoom" to fill the entire viewport.
        * The main slideshow card fades out, and the fullscreen image is slightly dimmed.
        * The "Thank You" message, "Previous/Next" navigation, and "Play Game Again?" button appear, fixed at the bottom, overlaying the dimmed fullscreen image.
        * Animated stars, balloons, and flowers continue to float over the fullscreen image.
        * The game holds on this final, immersive view.
